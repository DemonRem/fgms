1) kill -HUP <pid> does not reload the config file.

That's a bit complicated to implement. FGMS must store the name of the
config file and the values of all command line arguments. After a SIGHUP,
reload config file, apply the switch values and reinitialise fgms. The
configfile parser must be moved to fg_server.
