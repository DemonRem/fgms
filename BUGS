I moved the list of known bugs to sourceforge:

https://sourceforge.net/p/fgms/bugs/?source=navbar

If you find a yet unknown bug, please report it there. Note however that I
have disabled anonymous posts (I want to know who is writing ;), so you
have to register first.

===============================================================
Bugs not registered in above bug tracker:

1. [fgms v0.11.9] When the last pilot leaves, DISCONNECT packet becomes POSITION packet, leading the flight never ends
2. [fgms v0.11.9] Failed to reply PING message, leading unnecessary disconnection with FGTracker
3. [fgms v0.11.9] After disconnection because of bug 2, fgms will reconnect to FGTracker once there is pilot joining. However, the first CONNECT packet is missing, leading the flight cannot be tracked
