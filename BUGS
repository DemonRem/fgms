1) kill -HUP <pid> does not reload the config file.

That's a bit complicated to implement. FGMS must store the name of the
config file and the values of all command line arguments. After a SIGHUP,
reload config file, apply the switch values and reinitialise fgms. The
configfile parser must be moved to fg_server.

2) strange behavior if 'localhost' is configured as a relay

If you run a second instance of fgms on the same host and configure it as a
relay of the first instance, the first instance also receives the sent
packets and thinks it has a new user, adding him to the list. Could not
find out why.
